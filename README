This is a collection of IPython notebooks used for teaching
some basics of climate science, and documenting use of the 
climlab Python package.

Developed for a course at the University at Albany

This version has been updated to avoid pylab mode entirely
and to work with new climlab package.
The 'Seasonal Cycle' notebook still needs work.
